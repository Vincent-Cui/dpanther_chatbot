They issued licenses and conducted inspections at bars to ensure compliance with the laws.\\n\\n2. Public Sentiment: Among the public, there seems to have been a mix of opinions about prohibition. Some people were supportive of the laws, as indicated by the formation of the \"Greater Miami Council of Churches\" and the \"Laymen’s Committee of 1,000\". These groups held public meetings to discuss issues such as gambling and the breakdown of law enforcement, which they saw as linked to alcohol consumption.\\n\\n3.
